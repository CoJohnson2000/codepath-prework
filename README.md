## Required Functionality

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [x] Game interface has a heading (h1 tag), a line of body text (p tag), and four buttons that match the demo app
* [x] "Start" button toggles between "Start" and "Stop" when clicked. 
* [x] Game buttons each light up and play a sound when clicked. 
* [x] Computer plays back sequence of clues including sound and visual cue for each button
* [x] Play progresses to the next turn (the user gets the next step in the pattern) after a correct guess. 
* [x] User wins the game after guessing a complete pattern
* [x] User loses the game after an incorrect guess

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [ ] Any HTML page elements (including game buttons) has been styled differently than in the tutorial
* [ ] Buttons use a pitch (frequency) other than the ones in the tutorial
* [ ] More than 4 functional game buttons
* [ ] Playback speeds up on each turn
* [ ] Computer picks a different pattern each time the game is played
* [ ] Player only loses after 3 mistakes (instead of on the first mistake)
* [ ] Game button appearance change goes beyond color (e.g. add an image)
* [ ] Game button sound is more complex than a single tone (e.g. an audio file, a chord, a sequence of multiple tones)
* [ ] User has a limited amount of time to enter their guess on each turn

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [ ] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app!

## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here. 
  I did not use any outside resources to help complete this project.

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 
  The only challange I faced while doing this project was a self made error and challange of changing the name of a variable I miss named. The name of the stop button, stopBtn, I had originally had as endBtn, but following the instruction's code lead to bugs and errors as they did not have a endBtn. Overcomming this error was simply looking at the code as a whole and through the console to see an error of button not found. 

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
  My main questions about web development after completing this project is just a curiosity of how more complex websites work behind the scenes in the HTML and javascript/other languages a company might use. Such as how youtube works to display everything. 

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
  If I had a few more hours to work on this project I would spend them adding more functionality to this project. I would implement a number of ways to improve the functionailty of the game, namely a true random generation of the pattern. Right now it is the same every time, but a simple loop to the startGame function would change that. After that I would change the game from a win/lose senario to a game in which you play for as long as you can. Adding another number/color to the pattern after every choice and when you lose it displayes your score. Lastly I would add a color picker for the buttons so that they be changed for those who are unable to truely see the difference in colors when a button is played by the pattern.
